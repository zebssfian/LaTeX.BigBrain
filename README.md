# LaTeX.BigBrain
A place for big brain latex stylesheets

Read the instructions; 

I am by no means an expert in LaTeX, I just try to make my life a little bit easier.

Please change the color for the solution and solproof environments (now conveniently defined as 'col' at the beginning of the stylesheet), BlueViolet is my thing (I have decreed it to be so).
